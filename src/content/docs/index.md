# Welcome to the DSA Handbook

This documentation site serves as a personal reference for mastering Data Structures and Algorithms — whether you're preparing for coding interviews, studying for GATE, or strengthening your core computer science concepts.

## What You'll Find Here

- Time and space complexity analysis with examples  
- Core data structures: Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Heaps, Tries, Graphs, and more  
- Algorithmic paradigms: Sorting, Searching, Greedy, Divide & Conquer, Backtracking  
- Dynamic Programming techniques and patterns  
- Graph algorithms: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s Algorithm, Topological Sort, Union-Find, etc.  
- Conceptual explanations, handpicked problems, and derivations

## How to Use

Use the sidebar to navigate through topics.  
Content is organized by category — such as Sorting, Graphs, and Dynamic Programming — for structured exploration.
